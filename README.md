# Assignment

## HTML assignment
The goal of this HTML assignment is the creation of ficitive blog homepage. Use the existing HTML document, remove everything you don't need and start from there.

You don't have to implement any page other than the blog start page.

The blog homepage should contain the following items:
  * A list of blog post teasers  
    Be creative and just invent a couple of topics or use lorem ipsum
  * Each teaser should consist of an image, a title, a short description and a link to a detail page (you don't have to implement a detail page!)
  * The blog hompage needs a catchy headline
  * The blog homepage should have a footer that holds meta information for the blog
  * Add a navigation with navigation items that lead to other fictitious sections of the blog (don't build those pages)

Always keep the semantics of your homepage in mind!
HTML provides a lot of building blocks that you can use to properly define the elements of your website.

_Formatting and styling is not part of this assignment! Only concentrate on the pure HTML based document structure._

## CSS assignment
* Introduce a sidebar with some (fictitious) blog related content
* the sidebar should be positioned on the side of the list of blog posts

## ECO system assignment
* install the package `hirestime` from npm (it supports typescript!)
