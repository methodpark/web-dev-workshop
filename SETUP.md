# Setup

## Prerequisites

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version â‰¥ 14.x required, latest LTS
recommended) to be able to run this project.

> *Note:* If you don't have Node.js yet, make sure to restart any shells or your
> IDE after the Node.js installer has finished, so that the newly installed
> `npm` command is found by them.

You can use the editor/IDE of your choice, but when in doubt, we recommend
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Use `npm start` to start the application stub

This compiles the app and opens a browser.
